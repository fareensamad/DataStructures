This repository contains a selection of coding assignments completed as part of my coursework in data structures. The projects demonstrate my understanding of core concepts and highlight my problem-solving and coding skills.

Note: The files were uploaded individually after project completion. As a result, the commit history does not reflect the full development process or incremental changes made throughout the course. However, the code accurately represents the work I completed.
