COMP272 Programming Assignment 1


This repository is to be used for programming assignment #1. The Main.java file is the main driver which performs the testing. Do NOT modify this file. You must pass all supplied tests that are currently contained in the file Main.java to get full credit.

This assignment has three parts. The first part is writing two methods that manipulate a linked-list. The second part allows you to utilize the stack class contained in Java's Collection Framework library. The last part is performing simple algorithms analysis on two methods and returning the correct option number for each.

Difficulty Level / Grading: 
These should be fairly easy and s
sraightforward. All tests must be passed to get full credit. When you run the program, it will display the points you will receive (minus the tests for the algorithm analysis -- this latter will br graded manually when the program is ran.
